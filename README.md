## Introduction

I created this project with some starter code from Udacity's Javascript
Fullstack Nanodegree. This application can be combined with a front-end
e-commerce site to access information about the store. Data about users,
orders, and products can be easily retrieved through the connection
to the Postgres database.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the latest versions of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/node).
To install the other requirements, just run `yarn install`.

## Usage

The database can be accessed through port 5432, the default. 
TODO: Explain more how to connect to the database

To run the development server, just use the command `yarn watch` with
the Node terminal. You can access different endpoints through
'http://localhost:3000':

## Testing

This application includes Jasmine tests. To run, execute `jasmine` in 
the terminal.
